# First Official App, Code Refactor

## Task

My task was to review and refactor sample html and css files, modifying the code to make it easier to read and follow.

<!-- Refactoring--> Taking what we learned in the first week of class I was able to read and understand the basics of html and css syntax, as well as make various modifications to make it smoother to read and understand for the reader/developer.

<!--Accessibility--> I also applied a small portion of what we've learned in our second week of class, and made minor modifications to the css code thus allowing for a minimally responsive webpage. The purpose of this was to further practice what I've learned both in class and from the pre-work, as well as to add to the accessibility aspect of the assignment.

## User Story

```
As a developer at a marketing agency
I followed accessibility standards to review and refactor code for a fellow developer, with the focus of accessibility so that the site is optmized for SEO.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN the goal of meeting accessibility standards to optimize the site for SEO
WHEN I reviewed the code I made sure that proper semantic HTML elements were in place
SO THAT the syntax clearly conveyed the "instructions" for the browser as to the specific positioning of various sections and texts within the body, in addition to the overall layout of the webpage via CSS.
WHEN I reviewed the syntax structure I made modifications such as consolidating snippets to discard redundancies and adding variables for efficiency.
SO THAT the code was cleaner and smoother to read.
WHEN I reviewd the img elements I added alt tags with a brief disciption of the image
SO THAT anyone unable to physically see the image might still get an accurate depiction of it as per accessibility standards
WHEN I viewed the heading attributes I made sure they were positioned in proper sequential order
SO THAT their placement followed clear parent-child relativity that fit cascading-style chronology.
WHEN I reviewed the title element I added a concise and descriptive title
SO THAT the viewer would be able to immediately get a brief but thorough introduction to the page's content. 
```
